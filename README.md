# TCRTKINS
A naive implementation: Tightly coupled single frequency GPS BDS RTKINS in C++.

Our open-source implementation is only a preliminary architecture. It does not represent the state-of-the-art. The architecture needs more modules, including reliable cycle slip repair, gross error preprocessing, and fixed solution verification. 

TCRTKINS says:
I am based on RTKLIB, PSINS, and GINAV.
I admire these excellent open-source projects. I hope one day I can become as good as them.
